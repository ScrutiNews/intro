# Intro
Introduction to ScrutiNews on Github

## What is ScrutiNews?
ScrutiNews is a proposed project to change the way we read and discuss the daily news events.  Many of us will browse our favourite news websites every day, encouter news posts from friends on social media, or tune into the daily news on TV and radio. We like keeping abreast of current events. Many of us also comment on news items online, or discuss events in the news at work or when socialising.

But there's a growing awarenes that news can be 'faked' or distorted, we don't know what news to trust, and ensuing discussions and debate soon descend into slurs and abuse.

The basic idea behind ScrutiNews is to engourage those people who take great interest in news events, to become paid 'Scrutineers', applying analysis and fact checking to news stories using a thorough methodology, so that readers know how much they can trust a story, as well as understanding the range of alternative viewpoints.

## Thoughts, unknowns, and questions about this project:


> "Thanks for taking interest in this little project. Tackling the lies, propaganda, distortions and prejudice in everyday news is a noble cause, and one that I hope will motivate people to get involved. I don't know exactly where support will come from and how big it will be, but I know it will be needed to make this crazy idea a reality. Thanks for taking a look and I hope the sentiments expressed here will encourage your participation..." -  John Durrant, February 2018. -
